# Friday B&E ordering app

:bread: :pig: :egg: :bread: :coffee: :coffee:

## Description

In our Sydney office there's a little friday tradition where the tech team goes out for breakfast to take advantage of
a local cafe's cheap bacon and egg rolls (with a coffee). However everyone's preference for breakfast and especially
coffee is very different and a little hard to remember.

### Requirements

The Breakfast order app will need to accept two json files.
 - price-list.json containing the items on sale at our cafe
 - orders.json containing everyone's orders and the money they are paying.

The app will process these two files and output a JSON array containing the change for each user who ordered something.

This project has been bootstraped with helpers to get you started

```bash
# to get started
